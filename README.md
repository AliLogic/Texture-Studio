# What is a "Texture Studio"

Texture Studio is an advanced, server-based map editor. You can use Texture Studio for practically any kind of SA-MP map. It has many features that allow you to create, texture, and modify SA-MP maps with ease.

# Features

### Map Management

* Maps are saved in database files containing all of their objects, vehicles, and settings (author name, creation date, last modification date, spawn position, etc).
* You can load, save, rename, and even delete maps in-game.
* PAWN map code can be imported and exported in multiple formats.

### Map Editor

* You can use commands or the GUI for most features, we've provided both so it's up to the user to decide which works best for them.
* Basic functionality such as creating, destroying, moving, and also cloning objects.
* Set notes, model, and many other properties for each object.
* Object models can be searched with visually represented results.
* Use flymode to fly around the map with ease... with additional settings for speed and acceleration.
* Command binds can be used to save multiple commands to a list that can be executed later.
* Advanced in-game help command that lists all commands and tells what each of them do.
* Undo support to take back the command that deleted your whole map.
